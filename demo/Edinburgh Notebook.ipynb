    "Let $Mult(\\mathbb{C})$ be the set of all multiplicative functions (from the positive integers to the complex numbers). This set contains for example the Euler phi function, the Mobius mu function, the divisor functions $\\sigma_k$, the Liouville function, and many other classical number-theoretic functions. In addition, every number-theoretic object with an L-function (such as a motive, a scheme, a Galois representation or an automorphic representation) also has an associated multiplicative function, obtained by reading off the coefficients of the Dirichlet series describing the L-function. Finally, many number-theoretic functions which are not multiplicative, can be interpreted within the framework of multiplicative functions, if we allow more general target rings than $\\mathbb{C}$. \n",

    "The set of multiplicative functions comes with many binary operations, such as Dirichlet convolution, unitary convolution, and the usual (pointwise) product of functions. It also carries many unary operations studied in the literature, such as the k'th convolute, the norm and higher norm operators of Redmond and Sivaramakrishnan, operators given by precomposition with $n \\mapsto n^k$, and many others. A natural question is this: _What kind of algebraic structure is $Mult(\\mathbb{C})$_?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a paper (which is currently in fairly readable draft form) we review all operations studied in the literature, and show that they are all part of a rich algebraic structure which is closely related to the notion of a lambda-ring, first invented by Grothendieck. This unifies and clarifies many previously unrelated phenomena in number theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of a lambda-ring appears naturally in many different parts of mathematics:\n",
    "* The representation ring of a finite group is a lambda-ring\n",
    "* More generally, the Grothendieck ring of a symmetric monoidal abelian category is a lambda-ring\n",
    "* Any binomial ring (in the sense of Hall) is a lambda-ring\n",
    "* The topological K-theory of a topological space is a lambda-ring\n",

We are not aiming for an abstract implementation of lambda-rings (although this could perhaps be interesting), but rather a practical implementation of _Tannakian symbols_, which is a tool for computations in lambda-rings, analogous to the way matrices are a tool for computations in associative algebras, and polynomials are a tool for computations in commutative rings."

    "* Any commutative ring $R$ is in particular a multiplicative monoid, and hence we can form $TS(R)$. This is not just a lambda-ring, but carries an even richer structure, with many different algebraic operations (in the article, we introduce axioms for \"double Adams algebras\", which describe these operations). \n",
    "* If the ring $R$ happens to be the complex numbers, even more operations arise naturally, many of which are described below.\n",
    "* TS is a functor, in the simplest setting from the category of commutative monoids to the category of lambda-rings.\n",

# zeta-types-smc
This repository is a copy of the sagemath cloud. It will let you use code for computing with Tannakian Symbols and Multiplicative Functions.

# Installation
Everything can be done free of charge, but we recommend paying for CoCalc, as the services it provides are excellent.

1. Create a CoCalc Project (and account if you haven't already)
* If you are willing to pay for internet access, you can create a terminal and write 'git clone "https://github.com/torstein-vik/zeta-types-smc/"'.
* If you are not willing to pay, download a release (for instance [https://github.com/torstein-vik/zeta-types-smc/releases/tag/v1.0](https://github.com/torstein-vik/zeta-types-smc/releases/tag/v1.0)), upload it to CoCalc, and unpack the zip file.

Inside Worksheets-For-Testing you can test out the code we have shown. In particular, Edinburgh/Obergurl Notebook.ipynb contains a tutorial for using the code.

Technical help will always be available by mailing me ([mailto:torsteinv64@gmail.com](torsteinv64@gmail.com)). Seriously, I would be ecstatic if someone were to contact me about help :)
